# Babel 3D Folder Explorer

Welcome to Babel a new way of accessing and viewing your files!

## Why try Babel?

Babel is an experimental folder explorer that generates a fully navigable 3D library where all of the files specified by you will appear.

### Babel rules:

Babel follows three simple rules when creating your personal library:

1. **Each folder will be represented as a hexagon room fitted with shelves**
2. **Rooms that are located further down are subdirectories of rooms above**
3. **No two rooms can overlap i.e. every room has a unique 3D point in space allocated**

You can navigate through all of the rooms and open your files directly from within Babel!

**Beware even simple folder structures can be very big don't get lost in your own folders** :wink:
